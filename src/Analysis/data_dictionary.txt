Guide to Dataframe output from AE Study 1

Dataset - string - indicates the image classification problem used, possibly including a further string indicating the AEs generated.
    Will be the same for all examples from that data.

Example# - int - indicates the example image from the dataset that is being looked at.  Will be the same for all perturbations of that example.

Approx_conf - float - crude measure of the model's confidence in its label, obtained by the difference in top 2 class output.  If this is low, we might not expect meaningful AE ideas.

direction_type - string - category for the type of perturbation.
    Possible values:  gradient, neg-gradient, gaussian, ortho_group, gaas, gaas_convex_combo

direction_id - int - ordinal number of direction, for cases where multiple random directions are tried

y - int - the assigned label of the unperturbed image.  We only look at examples where this is output by the model.

y_hat - int - the new label of the perturbed image in the given direction.  If successful, should be different from y

boundary_distance - float - the first stepped distance in the given direction that changes the class label.
    If no class change within the maximum moved distance, may be inf (which we can replace with some large value for analysis)

delta_loss - float - the change in loss along the direction, computed as the loss at the point where the decision changes minus the loss at the starting image (fixed)

k - int - candidate dimension for the adversarial subspace.

ell2_grad - float - norm of the gradient at x (currently L2-norm)
